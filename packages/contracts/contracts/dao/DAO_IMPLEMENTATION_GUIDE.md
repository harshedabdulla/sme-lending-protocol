## Overview

We've built a **DAO-based lending protocol** that allows small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to get loans with **less collateral** by using **social trust**. Think of it like a community vouching system where existing trusted members can back new borrowers, reducing the amount of collateral needed.

### What Makes This Special?

Traditional DeFi lending requires 100%+ collateral (you need to lock up $100 to borrow $100). Our system allows borrowers to get loans with as little as **20% collateral** if enough community members vouch for them.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional DeFi Lending Issues:
1. **Over-collateralization**: Borrowers need to lock more money than they borrow
2. **No trust factor**: The system doesn't consider reputation or social relationships
3. **Capital inefficiency**: SMEs can't access capital because they lack crypto collateral
4. **One-size-fits-all**: Everyone pays the same regardless of trustworthiness

### Our Solution:
1. **Partial collateral**: As low as 20% with community backing
2. **Social trust**: Members vouch for borrowers based on relationships and due diligence
3. **Progressive trust**: Build reputation over time, get better terms
4. **Risk sharing**: Community shares both risks and rewards

---

## Core Concept

### The Big Idea

Imagine a lending club where:
- **Existing members** vote to admit new members
- **Trusted members** can vouch for borrowers
- **More vouchers** = less collateral needed
- **Good actors** build reputation and earn rewards
- **Bad actors** lose money and get kicked out

This is exactly what our DAO does, but on the blockchain with smart contracts enforcing all the rules.

## Detailed Contract Explanations

### 1. GovernanceToken.sol - The Voting Power Token

**What it is:**
A standard cryptocurrency token (like USDC or DAI) that members use to participate in governance.

**Key Features:**

#### Staking System
Members don't just hold tokens - they must **stake** (lock up) tokens to participate:
```
User has 1000 tokens
↓
Stakes 500 tokens (locks them)
↓
Now has 500 voting power
↓
Can vote on proposals and back loans
```

**Why staking?**
- It ensures people have "skin in the game"
- Staked tokens can be slashed (taken away) if you behave badly
- You can't just buy tokens and immediately vote - you must commit

#### The Staking Process:

**Step 1: Stake Tokens**
```javascript
// User calls this function
governanceToken.stake(500 * 10**18) // Stake 500 tokens

// What happens:
// - Tokens moved from user wallet to contract
// - User's staked amount increases
// - User gains voting power equal to staked amount
```

**Step 2: Participate** (vote, back loans, etc.)

**Step 3: Unstake (when you want to leave)**
```javascript
// Request unstake - starts 7-day cooldown
governanceToken.requestUnstake(500 * 10**18)

// Wait 7 days...

// Complete unstake
governanceToken.unstake()
// Tokens returned to wallet
```

**Why 7 days?**
- Prevents people from gaming votes (stake, vote, unstake immediately)
- Ensures commitment to decisions made
- Standard governance practice (similar to Compound, Aave)

#### Slashing Mechanism

If you consistently back borrowers who default (don't repay), you get **slashed** (lose 10% of your stake).

**How it works:**
```
You backed 10 loans
↓
5 of them defaulted (50% failure rate)
↓
System recognizes pattern of bad judgment
↓
10% of your staked tokens are burned (destroyed)
↓
You lose money + reputation damage
```

**Why slashing?**
- Punishes bad actors
- Incentivizes careful due diligence
- Protects the protocol from attacks
- Aligns incentives (you lose if borrowers default)

**Parameters:**
- Minimum stake to participate: **100 tokens**
- Minimum stake to back loans: **500 tokens** (requires more commitment)
- Unstake cooldown: **7 days**
- Slash percentage: **10%** per violation

---

### 2. ReputationNFT.sol - The Trust Score System

**What it is:**
A special NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that tracks your reputation in the DAO. Think of it like a permanent credit score that's attached to your wallet address.

**Special Property: Soul-Bound**
This NFT **cannot be transferred or sold**. It's permanently attached to your wallet.

**Why?**
- Prevents reputation trading (can't buy a good reputation)
- Ensures reputation is authentic
- Similar to real-world credentials (you can't sell your college degree)

#### How Reputation Works:

**1. Initial Reputation**
When you join the DAO, you receive a reputation NFT with:
- Score: **500/1000** (neutral starting point)
- Backing history: Empty
- Join date: Current timestamp

**2. Building Reputation**
Every time you back a loan, the outcome is recorded:

**Successful Loan (Borrower repays):**
```
Before: Score = 500, Successful = 0, Failed = 0
↓
Back a loan
↓
Loan is repaid successfully
↓
After: Score = 550, Successful = 1, Failed = 0
```

**Failed Loan (Borrower defaults):**
```
Before: Score = 500, Successful = 0, Failed = 0
↓
Back a loan
↓
Loan defaults
↓
After: Score = 450, Successful = 0, Failed = 1
```

**3. Score Calculation Formula**

The reputation score is calculated based on:
- **Success rate**: What % of your backed loans were repaid?
- **Experience**: How many loans have you backed?

```javascript
// Simplified formula:
if (total backed loans == 0) {
    score = 500 // Neutral for new members
} else {
    success_rate = (successful loans / total loans) * 1000

    // Weight by experience
    // More experience = score closer to actual success rate
    // Less experience = score closer to neutral (500)

    experience_weight = min(total_backed, 50)
    score = (success_rate * experience_weight + 500 * (50 - experience_weight)) / 50
}
```

**Example:**

**New member (1 loan backed, 1 success):**
- Success rate: 100% = 1000 score potential
- Experience weight: 1/50
- Actual score: `(1000 × 1 + 500 × 49) / 50 = 510`
- Only slightly above neutral despite 100% success

**Experienced member (50 loans backed, 45 success):**
- Success rate: 90% = 900 score potential
- Experience weight: 50/50
- Actual score: `(900 × 50 + 500 × 0) / 50 = 900`
- Score directly reflects success rate

**Why this formula?**
- Prevents gaming with small sample sizes
- Rewards consistent good performance
- Protects new members from early mistakes
- More data = more accurate score

#### Reputation Effects:

**High Reputation (800-1000):**
- More voting weight in governance
- People trust your loan backing decisions
- Higher chance of getting your loan backed
- Potential future benefits (lower fees, etc.)

**Medium Reputation (500-800):**
- Standard member privileges
- Building trust over time

**Low Reputation (0-500):**
- Warning sign to other members
- May be slashed soon if pattern continues
- Harder to get support for your own loans
- Potential suspension from DAO

---

### 3. DAOMembership.sol - The Gatekeeper

**What it is:**
This contract controls who can join the DAO. It implements a democratic voting system where existing members decide if new people should be admitted.

**Why do we need this?**
- Prevents spam/bot accounts
- Ensures quality community
- Creates accountability (members vouched for you)
- Protects against Sybil attacks (one person creating many accounts)

#### The Admission Process:

**Step 1: Someone Proposes You**

An existing member must believe in you enough to propose your membership:

```javascript
// Existing member calls this
daoMembership.proposeMembership(
    "0x..." // Your wallet address
    "John is a small business owner with 5 years experience in textiles.
     I've known him personally for 3 years and trust his integrity."
)
```

**What happens:**
- Proposal is created with ID (e.g., Proposal #42)
- 7-day voting period starts
- Proposer automatically votes "YES" with their voting power
- Your status changes to "Pending"

**Step 2: Voting Period (7 days)**

During these 7 days, existing members review your proposal and vote:

```javascript
// Member A votes YES
daoMembership.vote(42, true)
// Their voting power (staked tokens) added to "votes for"

// Member B votes NO
daoMembership.vote(42, false)
// Their voting power added to "votes against"
```

**How voting power works:**
- If you have 1000 tokens staked = 1000 voting power
- If you have 100 tokens staked = 100 voting power
- More stake = more influence (plutocratic system)

**Why?** Members with more stake have more to lose, so they're incentivized to vote carefully.

**Step 3: Execution**

After 7 days, anyone can execute the proposal:

```javascript
daoMembership.executeProposal(42)
```

**The system calculates:**
```
Total Votes For: 10,000 voting power
Total Votes Against: 4,000 voting power
Total Votes: 14,000

Approval Percentage = (10,000 / 14,000) * 100 = 71.4%

Required: 66.67% (2/3 majority)
Result: 71.4% >= 66.67% ✅ APPROVED
```

**If approved:**
1. Your status changes from "Pending" to "Active"
2. A Reputation NFT is minted for you (starting score: 500)
3. You receive 1000 governance tokens as a welcome gift
4. You can now participate fully in the DAO

**If rejected:**
1. Your status resets to "None"
2. You can be proposed again later (if someone believes in you)

#### Why 2/3 Majority (66.67%)?

**Not simple majority (51%):** Too easy to pass, less consensus required
**Not unanimous (100%):** Too hard to pass, one person can block
**2/3 is the sweet spot:**
- Requires broad consensus
- Used by many constitutions and governance systems
- High enough bar to ensure quality
- Low enough to be achievable

---

### 4. LoanVoting.sol - The Heart of the System ⭐

This is the **most important contract**. It implements the dynamic collateral system where social trust reduces collateral requirements.

#### The Revolutionary Idea: Dynamic Collateral

**Traditional System:**
- Borrow $1000 → Need $1000+ collateral (100%+)
- Everyone same rules, no trust factor

**Our System:**
- Borrow $1000 with 0 backers → Need $1000 collateral (100%)
- Borrow $1000 with 5 backers → Need $600 collateral (60%)
- Borrow $1000 with 10 backers → Need $200 collateral (20%)

**The Formula:**
```
Required Collateral % = max(100 - (number of backers × 8), 20)

Examples:
- 0 backers:  100 - (0 × 8) = 100%
- 3 backers:  100 - (3 × 8) = 76%
- 5 backers:  100 - (5 × 8) = 60%
- 10 backers: 100 - (10 × 8) = 20% (hits minimum)
- 15 backers: 100 - (15 × 8) = -20% → max(−20, 20) = 20% (minimum floor)
```

**Why these numbers?**
- **8% reduction per backer**: Meaningful but not too aggressive
- **20% minimum**: Always some collateral (skin in game)
- **100% maximum**: Protects protocol from zero-collateral attacks

#### The Loan Request Flow (Detailed):

**Step 1: Borrower Requests Loan**

```javascript
// Borrower (SME owner) calls this
loanVoting.requestLoan(
    1000 * 10**6,  // Amount: $1000 USDT
    60              // Willing to provide 60% collateral ($600)
)
```

**What the contract checks:**
1. ✅ Is caller an active DAO member?
2. ✅ Is amount > 0?
3. ✅ Is collateral percentage ≤ 100%?
4. ✅ Does borrower have any active loans? (No multi-borrowing)
5. ✅ Is borrower's credit score above minimum?

**What happens if all pass:**
- Loan request created with ID (e.g., Request #7)
- 3-day voting period starts
- Request stored with details:
  ```javascript
  {
    borrower: "0x...",
    amount: 1000 USDT,
    requestedCollateral: 60%,
    startTime: now,
    endTime: now + 3 days,
    backers: [],
    backerCount: 0
  }
  ```

**Step 2: Members Back the Loan**

During the 3-day period, members can back the loan:

```javascript
// Member calls this
loanVoting.backLoan(7) // Request ID
```

**What the contract checks:**
1. ✅ Is caller an active DAO member?
2. ✅ Is caller NOT the borrower? (Can't back your own loan)
3. ✅ Is voting period still active?
4. ✅ Has caller already backed this loan? (Can't back twice)
5. ✅ Does caller have minimum 500 tokens staked?

**What happens when backing:**
```javascript
// Member has 2000 tokens staked
loanVoting.backLoan(7)

// System records:
request.backers.push(member_address)
request.backingAmount[member_address] = 2000
request.backerCount++ // Now = 1

// This backing amount is used later for:
// - Calculating member's share of losses if default
// - Weighted distribution of interest if success
```

**Multiple members back:**
```
Day 1: Alice backs (1000 voting power) → backerCount = 1
Day 2: Bob backs (500 voting power) → backerCount = 2
Day 2: Carol backs (3000 voting power) → backerCount = 3
Day 3: Dave backs (800 voting power) → backerCount = 4
```

**Step 3: Execution (After 3 Days)**

Anyone can trigger execution:

```javascript
loanVoting.executeRequest(7)
```

**The contract calculates:**

```javascript
// Calculate required collateral based on backers
required_collateral = calculateRequiredCollateral(4) // 4 backers
// = max(100 - (4 × 8), 20)
// = max(100 - 32, 20)
// = max(68, 20)
// = 68%

// Check approval conditions:
condition_1 = (backerCount >= minBackers) // 4 >= 3 ✅
condition_2 = (requestedCollateral >= required_collateral) // 60% >= 68% ❌

// Result: REJECTED (insufficient collateral)
```

**What if borrower offered 70% collateral?**
```
condition_1 = (4 >= 3) ✅
condition_2 = (70% >= 68%) ✅

// Result: APPROVED ✅
```

**When APPROVED:**

1. **Insurance fee collected:**
   ```javascript
   fee = loan_amount * 1% = $1000 * 0.01 = $10
   insurancePool.collectFee(loan_amount)
   // $10 goes to insurance pool
   ```

2. **Loan disbursed via LoanManager:**
   ```javascript
   loanManager.requestLoan(990) // $1000 - $10 fee
   // Borrower receives $990 USDT
   ```

3. **Borrower must provide collateral:**
   ```javascript
   // Borrower transfers 68% of $1000 = $680 worth of collateral
   // (This would be handled by collateral management contract)
   ```

4. **Loan becomes active**, tracked by both:
   - LoanManager (for repayment tracking)
   - LoanVoting (for backer tracking)

#### Step 4: What Happens Next?

**Scenario A: Borrower Repays Successfully 🎉**

```javascript
// Borrower repays over time
loanManager.repayLoan(amount)

// When fully repaid, LoanVoting is notified
loanVoting.handleRepayment(7)
```

**The contract does:**

```javascript
// For each backer:
for (backer in backers) {
    // 1. Update their reputation
    reputationNFT.recordBacking(backer, true) // true = success

    // 2. Track total backed (for statistics)
    backerLosses[backer].totalBacked += backingAmount[backer]

    // 3. Distribute interest (proportional to backing)
    interest_share = (total_interest * backingAmount[backer]) / total_backing_power
    // Transfer interest to backer
}
```

**Example interest distribution:**
```
Total interest earned: $100
Total backing power: 5300 (1000+500+3000+800)

Alice (1000 power): $100 × (1000/5300) = $18.87
Bob (500 power):    $100 × (500/5300) = $9.43
Carol (3000 power): $100 × (3000/5300) = $56.60
Dave (800 power):   $100 × (800/5300) = $15.09
```

**Everyone wins:**
- Borrower got loan with only 68% collateral ✅
- Backers earned high interest (higher than DeFi yields) ✅
- Reputations increased ✅
- Protocol collected fee ✅

---

**Scenario B: Borrower Defaults 😞**

Deadline passes, loan not fully repaid.

```javascript
// Anyone can call this
loanManager.markAsDefault(borrower_address)

// Admin calculates loss and calls
loanVoting.handleDefault(
    7,           // Request ID
    500 * 10**6  // Loss amount: $500 (amount not repaid)
)
```

**The contract calculates loss distribution:**

```javascript
// Total backing power: 5300
// Loss to distribute: $500

// For each backer, calculate their share:
for (backer in backers) {
    backer_share = (loss_amount × backing_amount) / total_backing

    // Alice: $500 × (1000/5300) = $94.34 loss
    // Bob:   $500 × (500/5300) = $47.17 loss
    // Carol: $500 × (3000/5300) = $283.02 loss
    // Dave:  $500 × (800/5300) = $75.47 loss

    // Record the loss
    backerLosses[backer].totalLost += backer_share
    backerLosses[backer].lossCount++

    // Update reputation (negative)
    reputationNFT.recordBacking(backer, false) // false = failure
}
```

**But wait - Insurance Pool helps!**

```javascript
// Insurance pool files claim
insurancePool.fileClaim(
    borrower,
    1000, // Original loan
    500,  // Loss amount
    [Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave] // Backers to compensate
)

// Insurance calculates coverage
coverage = min(500 * 30%, available_balance)
coverage = min(150, available_balance)
// Assuming pool has funds: coverage = $150

// Distribute insurance to backers
per_backer = $150 / 4 = $37.50 each

// Net losses after insurance:
// Alice: $94.34 - $37.50 = $56.84 actual loss
// Bob:   $47.17 - $37.50 = $9.67 actual loss
// Carol: $283.02 - $37.50 = $245.52 actual loss
// Dave:  $75.47 - $37.50 = $37.97 actual loss
```

**Slashing Check:**

The contract checks if any backer should be slashed:

```javascript
for (backer in backers) {
    // Check if they've had at least 5 defaults
    if (backerLosses[backer].lossCount >= 5) {
        // Calculate their loss rate
        loss_rate = (totalLost / totalBacked) * 100

        // If loss rate > 30%, slash them
        if (loss_rate > 30) {
            governanceToken.slash(
                backer,
                "Consistent backing of defaulting borrowers"
            )
            // They lose 10% of their staked tokens
        }
    }
}
```

**Example:**
```
Alice's history:
- Total backed: $10,000 in loans
- Total lost: $3,500
- Loss rate: 35%
- Default count: 6

35% > 30% AND count >= 5
→ Alice gets slashed (loses 10% of stake)
→ If she had 1000 tokens staked, 100 tokens burned
```

**Why this is fair:**
- Occasional bad luck is fine (30% threshold is generous)
- Only penalizes **consistent** bad judgment
- Requires pattern (5+ defaults)
- Protects protocol from gaming

### 5. YieldingPool.sol - The Passive Investment Option

**What it is:**
A safe, hands-off way for members to earn returns without actively evaluating loans.

**Target User:**
"I want to earn yield on my stablecoins, but I don't have time to evaluate loan requests or don't want the risk of backing individuals."

#### How It Works:

**1. Deposit**

```javascript
// User approves stablecoin spending first
stablecoin.approve(yieldingPool, 1000 * 10**6)

// Then deposits
yieldingPool.deposit(1000 * 10**6) // Deposit $1000
```

**Share-Based Accounting (Like a Vault):**

```javascript
// First depositor:
Total deposits in pool: 0
Total shares: 0

User deposits: $1000
Shares to mint: 1000 (1:1 ratio initially)

Result:
- User receives 1000 shares
- Pool has $1000
- Total shares: 1000

// Second depositor (after some yield earned):
Total deposits in pool: $1100 (first deposit + $100 yield)
Total shares: 1000

User deposits: $1000
Shares to mint: (1000 * 1000) / 1100 = 909 shares

Result:
- User receives 909 shares
- Pool has $2100
- Total shares: 1909

// Why different? First depositor's shares are worth more now
// 1000 shares × ($2100 / 1909) = $1100 value
// Second depositor: 909 shares × ($2100 / 1909) = $1000 value
```

**This is fair because:**
- Early depositors earned yield over time
- New depositors get current exchange rate
- Share value always equals pool value per share

**2. Yield Generation**

```javascript
// Pool deploys funds to DeFi protocols
// (In the contract, this is a placeholder - you'd integrate with Aave/Compound)

_deployToStrategy(1000)
// Funds go to Aave, earning ~5% APY

// Over time, Aave accrues interest
// After 1 year: $1000 becomes $1050

// Admin harvests yield
yieldingPool.harvestYield()
```

**What happens during harvest:**

```javascript
// Check balance before and after claiming from Aave
balance_before = $1000
_harvestFromStrategy() // Claim rewards from Aave
balance_after = $1050

yield_earned = $50

// Take performance fee (10%)
performance_fee = $50 * 10% = $5
net_yield = $50 - $5 = $45

// Add net yield back to pool (compounds for users)
totalDeposits += $45
// Now totalDeposits = $1045

// Redeploy to keep earning
_deployToStrategy($45)
```

**Effect on share value:**
```
Before harvest:
- Total deposits: $1000
- Total shares: 1000
- Share value: $1000/1000 = $1.00

After harvest:
- Total deposits: $1045
- Total shares: 1000 (unchanged)
- Share value: $1045/1000 = $1.045

Your shares appreciated in value!
```

**3. Withdrawal**

Withdrawals have a delay to prevent gaming:

```javascript
// Step 1: Request withdrawal
yieldingPool.requestWithdrawal(500) // 500 shares

// Sets up withdrawal request with 2-day delay
// Why? Prevents flash-loan attacks and gives pool time to manage liquidity
```

```javascript
// Step 2: Wait 2 days...

// Step 3: Complete withdrawal
yieldingPool.withdraw()
```

**Calculation:**
```javascript
// User has 500 shares
// Total deposits: $1045
// Total shares: 1000

withdrawal_amount = (500 * $1045) / 1000 = $522.50

// Withdrawal fee (0.5%)
fee = $522.50 * 0.5% = $2.61

// User receives
net_amount = $522.50 - $2.61 = $519.89

// Transfer to user
stablecoin.transfer(user, $519.89)

// Update state
user_shares -= 500
total_shares -= 500
total_deposits -= $522.50
```

**Why withdrawal fee?**
- Covers gas costs of rebalancing
- Slight incentive to stay deposited
- Prevents excessive in/out cycling
- Standard in DeFi vaults

#### Comparison: YieldingPool vs Active Backing

**YieldingPool:**
- ✅ Passive (no work required)
- ✅ Lower risk (diversified across many DeFi protocols)
- ✅ Predictable returns (~3-7% APY)
- ✅ No reputation effects
- ✅ No slashing risk
- ❌ Lower returns than backing
- ❌ No governance participation benefit

**Active Backing:**
- ✅ Higher returns (~10-20% on successful loans)
- ✅ Build reputation
- ✅ Increased governance weight
- ✅ Help real businesses
- ❌ Requires work (evaluate borrowers)
- ❌ Higher risk (borrower might default)
- ❌ Potential slashing if consistently wrong

**Both options available** - members choose based on:
- Risk tolerance
- Time availability
- Desire to participate actively
- Return requirements

### 6. InsurancePool.sol - The Safety Net

**What it is:**
A reserve fund that covers partial losses when borrowers default, protecting backers.

**Purpose:**
- Reduce backer risk
- Make backing more attractive
- Absorb small shocks to the system
- Build protocol stability

#### How It Gets Funded:

**1. Protocol Fees (Main Source)**

Every loan that's approved pays a 1% fee:

```javascript
// When loan approved:
loan_amount = $1000
fee = $1000 * 1% = $10

// LoanVoting calls:
insurancePool.collectFee(loan_amount)

// InsurancePool receives $10
totalCollected += $10
```

Over time, this builds up:
```
Month 1: 100 loans × $1000 avg × 1% = $1,000 collected
Month 2: 150 loans × $1000 avg × 1% = $1,500 collected
Month 3: 200 loans × $1000 avg × 1% = $2,000 collected

Total after 3 months: $4,500 in insurance pool
```

**2. Direct Deposits (Optional)**

Anyone can donate to the insurance pool:

```javascript
insurancePool.deposit(1000 * 10**6) // Donate $1000
```

**Why would someone donate?**
- Protocol founders/investors believing in long-term success
- Successful backers wanting to strengthen the ecosystem
- Grants from other DAOs/foundations

**3. Withdrawal Fees from YieldingPool**

```javascript
// When someone withdraws from YieldingPool:
withdrawal_fee = amount * 0.5%

// This fee could be directed to insurance pool
// (Would require integration between contracts)
```

#### How It Pays Out:

**Scenario: Loan Default**

```javascript
// Loan defaults with $500 loss
// 4 backers involved: [Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave]

// LoanVoting files claim:
insurancePool.fileClaim(
    borrower_address,
    1000,  // Original loan amount
    500,   // Loss amount
    [Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave]
)
```

**Coverage Calculation:**

```javascript
// Check if pool is healthy
available = insurancePool.getAvailableBalance() // $4,500
minimum_required = $10,000

if (available < minimum_required) {
    // Pool is low, no coverage
    coverage = 0
} else {
    // Calculate coverage (30% of loss)
    coverage = 500 * 30% = $150

    // But cap at available balance
    coverage = min($150, $4,500) = $150 ✅
}
```

**Why 30% coverage?**
- Meaningful reduction in backer risk
- Not so high that it creates moral hazard (backers still have skin in game)
- Sustainable for the pool
- Adjustable by governance if needed

**Payout:**

```javascript
// Distribute $150 equally among 4 backers
per_backer = $150 / 4 = $37.50

// Transfer to each backer
stablecoin.transfer(Alice, $37.50)
stablecoin.transfer(Bob, $37.50)
stablecoin.transfer(Carol, $37.50)
stablecoin.transfer(Dave, $37.50)

// Update pool state
totalPaidOut += $150
// Remaining: $4,500 - $150 = $4,350
```

**Effect on Backers:**

Without insurance:
```
Alice lost: $94.34
Bob lost: $47.17
Carol lost: $283.02
Dave lost: $75.47
```

With insurance:
```
Alice lost: $94.34 - $37.50 = $56.84 (40% reduction)
Bob lost: $47.17 - $37.50 = $9.67 (79% reduction)
Carol lost: $283.02 - $37.50 = $245.52 (13% reduction)
Dave lost: $75.47 - $37.50 = $37.97 (50% reduction)
```

**Weighted Distribution (Better Approach):**

Actually, the contract could distribute proportionally:

```javascript
// Instead of equal distribution ($37.50 each)
// Distribute based on their loss share:

total_loss = $500
alice_share = $94.34 / $500 = 18.87%
bob_share = $47.17 / $500 = 9.43%
carol_share = $283.02 / $500 = 56.60%
dave_share = $75.47 / $500 = 15.09%

// Distribute $150 coverage:
alice_coverage = $150 * 18.87% = $28.30
bob_coverage = $150 * 9.43% = $14.15
carol_coverage = $150 * 56.60% = $84.90
dave_coverage = $150 * 15.09% = $22.64

// Net losses:
Alice: $94.34 - $28.30 = $66.04 (30% reduction)
Bob: $47.17 - $14.15 = $33.02 (30% reduction)
Carol: $283.02 - $84.90 = $198.12 (30% reduction)
Dave: $75.47 - $22.64 = $52.83 (30% reduction)
```

Everyone gets exactly 30% of their loss covered - fair!

#### Pool Health Monitoring:

**Healthy Pool:**
```
Balance: $50,000
Minimum: $10,000
Status: ✅ Healthy
Coverage: 30% of losses
```

**Stressed Pool:**
```
Balance: $8,000
Minimum: $10,000
Status: ⚠️ Below minimum
Coverage: 0% (suspended until replenished)
```

**Why suspend coverage when low?**
- Prevents pool from going to zero
- Ensures it can handle future claims
- Signals to governance that fee might need adjustment

## How Everything Works Together

### Complete System Flow

Let me walk you through a complete example from start to finish:

#### Chapter 1: Alice Joins the DAO

**Day 0: Application**
```
Alice (new SME owner) → talks to existing member Bob
Bob believes in Alice → proposes her membership
```

```javascript
// Bob calls:
daoMembership.proposeMembership(
    alice_address,
    "Alice runs a successful textile business.
     I've verified her business registration and reviewed financials.
     She has 5 years of business history with strong cash flow."
)
```

**Days 1-7: Voting**
```
Members review Alice's proposal:
- Bob (proposer): 1000 power → FOR
- Carol: 2000 power → FOR
- Dave: 500 power → AGAINST
- Eve: 1500 power → FOR

Total FOR: 4,500
Total AGAINST: 500
Total: 5,000
Percentage: 90% approval ✅
```

**Day 7: Execution**
```javascript
daoMembership.executeProposal(alice_proposal_id)

// System:
// 1. Mints Reputation NFT for Alice (score: 500)
// 2. Sends Alice 1000 governance tokens
// 3. Sets Alice status to "Active"
```

Alice is now a full member! 🎉

#### Chapter 2: Alice Requests a Loan

**Day 10: Alice needs capital**

Alice needs $10,000 to buy new textile machinery. She has $4,000 in crypto assets for collateral.

```javascript
// Alice calls:
loanVoting.requestLoan(
    10000 * 10**6,  // $10,000
    40              // Willing to provide 40% collateral ($4,000)
)
```

**What Alice needs:**
- Required collateral depends on backers
- If 0 backers: needs 100% ($10,000) - She only has $4,000 ❌
- If 10 backers: needs 20% ($2,000) - She has $4,000 ✅

Alice needs at least 8 backers:
```
100 - (8 × 8) = 100 - 64 = 36% required
Alice offers 40% > 36% ✅
```

**Days 11-13: Members Back Alice**

Members evaluate Alice's request:

**Bob's thinking:**
"I proposed Alice, I believe in her business.
 Her financials look solid, cash flow is positive.
 I'll back her."

```javascript
bob.stake(1000 * 10**18) // Stakes tokens first
loanVoting.backLoan(alice_loan_id)
```

**Carol's thinking:**
"Bob has good judgment (reputation 850/1000).
 Alice's proposal was detailed.
 Textile industry is stable.
 I'll back this."

```javascript
carol.stake(2000 * 10**18)
loanVoting.backLoan(alice_loan_id)
```

**Dave, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Iris** also back Alice.

**Final count: 10 backers**

**Day 14: Execution**

```javascript
loanVoting.executeRequest(alice_loan_id)

// Calculates:
required_collateral = 100 - (10 × 8) = 20%
alice_offered = 40%
backers = 10 >= 3 minimum

// Result: APPROVED ✅

// Insurance fee collected: $10,000 × 1% = $100
insurancePool.collectFee(10000 * 10**6)

// Loan disbursed: $10,000 - $100 = $9,900 to Alice
loanManager.disburseLoan(alice_address, 9900 * 10**6)

// Alice provides $4,000 collateral
// (Locked in collateral manager)
```

Alice receives $9,900 in her wallet! 💰

#### Chapter 3: The Waiting Game

**Months 1-6: Alice uses the money**
```
Month 1: Alice buys textile machinery ($8,000)
Month 2: Machinery installed, production starts
Month 3: New products selling well
Month 4: Revenue increasing
Month 5: Profits accumulating
Month 6: Ready to start repaying
```

**During this time:**
- Loan is "Active" in LoanManager
- Alice's credit score being monitored
- Backers waiting for repayment
- Interest accruing according to terms

**Loan terms (example):**
```
Principal: $10,000
Interest rate: 12% (based on credit score)
Total owed: $10,000 + $1,200 = $11,200
Duration: 12 months
Monthly payment: ~$933
```

#### Chapter 4: Two Possible Endings

**Ending A: Success Story** 🎉

**Months 7-18: Alice repays**
```javascript
// Every month, Alice repays
loanManager.repayLoan(933 * 10**6)

// Payments tracked:
// Month 7: $933 paid, $10,267 remaining
// Month 8: $933 paid, $9,334 remaining
// ...
// Month 18: Final $933 paid, $0 remaining
```

**When fully repaid:**
```javascript
loanVoting.handleRepayment(alice_loan_id)

// System distributes $1,200 interest to 10 backers:
Total backing power: 15,000
Bob (1000): $1,200 × (1000/15000) = $80
Carol (2000): $1,200 × (2000/15000) = $160
Dave (1500): $1,200 × (1500/15000) = $120
... (etc for all 10 backers)

// Each backer's reputation increases:
reputationNFT.recordBacking(bob, true)
// Bob: 850 → 865
reputationNFT.recordBacking(carol, true)
// Carol: 780 → 795
// ... etc
```

**Everyone benefits:**
- Alice: Got loan with only 40% collateral, business grew ✅
- Backers: Earned 12% return (higher than DeFi's 5%) ✅
- Protocol: Collected $100 fee ✅
- Insurance pool: Didn't need to pay out, grew stronger ✅

**Alice's collateral returned:**
```
// Her $4,000 collateral unlocked and returned
collateralManager.returnCollateral(alice, 4000 * 10**6)
```

**Alice can now:**
- Request another loan (with better terms due to reputation)
- Back other members' loans
- Build her business further

---

**Ending B: Default** 😞

**Month 12: Alice's business struggles**
```
Unexpected event: Major customer goes bankrupt
Alice's revenue drops 70%
Cannot make loan payments
```

**Month 13: Deadline passes**
```javascript
// Deadline reached, loan not fully repaid
// Paid so far: $5,000 out of $11,200
// Remaining: $6,200 owed

// Anyone can call:
loanManager.markAsDefault(alice_address)
```

**Loss Calculation:**
```
Total owed: $11,200
Repaid: $5,000
Collateral liquidated: $4,000 (Alice's collateral seized)
Total recovered: $9,000
Loss: $11,200 - $9,000 = $2,200 to absorb
```

**Loss Distribution:**
```javascript
loanVoting.handleDefault(alice_loan_id, 2200 * 10**6)

// Distribute $2,200 loss among 10 backers:
Total backing power: 15,000

Bob (1000 power): $2,200 × (1000/15000) = $147 loss
Carol (2000 power): $2,200 × (2000/15000) = $293 loss
Dave (1500 power): $2,200 × (1500/15000) = $220 loss
... (etc)
```

**Insurance Helps:**
```javascript
insurancePool.fileClaim(
    alice_address,
    10000, // Original loan
    2200,  // Loss
    [bob, carol, dave, ...] // 10 backers
)

// Coverage: 30% of $2,200 = $660
// Distributed proportionally:
Bob receives: $147 × 30% = $44
Carol receives: $293 × 30% = $88
Dave receives: $220 × 30% = $66
... (etc)

// Net losses after insurance:
Bob: $147 - $44 = $103 actual loss
Carol: $293 - $88 = $205 actual loss
Dave: $220 - $66 = $154 actual loss
```

**Reputation Updates:**
```javascript
// Each backer's reputation decreases
reputationNFT.recordBacking(bob, false)
// Bob: 865 → 840 (down 25 points)

reputationNFT.recordBacking(carol, false)
// Carol: 795 → 775 (down 20 points)

// Everyone takes a hit, but not catastrophic
// (Especially if they have good history otherwise)
```

**Alice's Consequences:**
```
// Alice's status:
- Reputation destroyed
- Credit score tanks
- Banned from requesting new loans
- Collateral gone
- Business reputation damaged

// Cannot participate in borrowing again
```

**Backer Analysis:**

Bob's backing history after this:
```
Total backed: 5 loans
Successful: 4
Failed: 1 (Alice)
Success rate: 80%
Reputation: 840/1000 (still high)
No slashing (needs 5 defaults with >30% loss rate)
```

**Lessons learned:**
- Backing has real risk
- Due diligence matters
- Insurance helps but doesn't eliminate risk
- Diversification is key (don't back just one borrower)

---

## Economic Model

### Fee Structure

**1. Protocol Fee: 1% on loan disbursement**
```
$10,000 loan → $100 fee to insurance pool
$50,000 loan → $500 fee to insurance pool
$100,000 loan → $1,000 fee to insurance pool
```

**2. Withdrawal Fee: 0.5% from YieldingPool**
```
$10,000 withdrawal → $50 fee
$50,000 withdrawal → $250 fee
```

**3. Performance Fee: 10% of DeFi yields**
```
YieldingPool earns $1,000 in DeFi yields
→ $100 goes to protocol treasury
→ $900 compounds for users
```

### Revenue Projections

**Scenario: Moderate Growth**
```
Month 1:
- Loans issued: $100,000 total
- Protocol fee (1%): $1,000
- YieldingPool deposits: $50,000
- DeFi yield (5% APY): $208/month
- Performance fee (10%): $21

Total monthly revenue: $1,021

Month 6:
- Loans issued: $500,000 total
- Protocol fee: $5,000
- YieldingPool deposits: $300,000
- DeFi yield: $1,250/month
- Performance fee: $125

Total monthly revenue: $5,125

Month 12:
- Loans issued: $1,000,000 total
- Protocol fee: $10,000
- YieldingPool deposits: $750,000
- DeFi yield: $3,125/month
- Performance fee: $312

Total monthly revenue: $10,312
```

**Annual projection (Year 1):**
```
Total protocol revenue: ~$60,000
Allocated to:
- Insurance pool: 70% ($42,000)
- DAO treasury: 20% ($12,000)
- Development fund: 10% ($6,000)
```

### Incentive Alignment

**For Borrowers:**
```
Traditional DeFi:
- Need $10,000 collateral to borrow $10,000
- Capital inefficient
- No reputation benefit

Our DAO:
- Need $2,000-$10,000 collateral (depending on backers)
- Capital efficient
- Build reputation → easier future loans
- Personal relationships matter
```

**For Backers:**
```
DeFi Lending:
- Earn ~5% APY
- No personal involvement
- Fully secured

DAO Backing:
- Earn ~12-20% on success
- Personal judgment involved
- Partial insurance (30%)
- Build reputation and influence
```

**For Passive Investors:**
```
Traditional DeFi:
- Earn 3-7% on Aave/Compound directly
- No fees

DAO YieldingPool:
- Earn ~3-6% after fees
- Simpler interface
- Protocol access
- Support ecosystem
```

**For the Protocol:**
```
Sustainability:
- Fees fund insurance pool
- Insurance makes backing safer
- Safer backing → more loans
- More loans → more fees
- Positive feedback loop!
```

### Risk/Reward Matrix

```
┌────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬───────────────┐
│ Participation  │ Expected │ Risk     │ Time Required │
│ Mode           │ Return   │ Level    │               │

## Security & Risk Management

### Smart Contract Security

**1. Reentrancy Protection**

Every function that moves money has reentrancy guards:

```solidity
function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
    // nonReentrant modifier prevents:
    // 1. Calling withdraw()
    // 2. → Which calls user's contract
    // 3. → Which calls withdraw() again (reentrancy)
    // 4. → Draining contract

    // Instead: First call locks, second call reverts
}
```

**2. SafeERC20**

All token transfers use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20:

```solidity
// Instead of:
token.transfer(user, amount) // Might not revert on failure

// We use:
token.safeTransfer(user, amount) // Always reverts on failure
```

**3. Checks-Effects-Interactions**

```solidity
function repay() {
    // 1. CHECKS
    require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
    require(loan.status == Active, "No active loan");

    // 2. EFFECTS (update state BEFORE external calls)
    loan.amountRepaid += amount;
    if (loan.amountRepaid >= loan.totalOwed) {
        loan.status = Repaid;
    }

    // 3. INTERACTIONS (external calls LAST)
    token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
}
```

**Why?** If external call fails or does something malicious, state is already protected.

**4. Access Control**

```solidity
// Owner-only functions
function setMinBackers(uint256 _min) external onlyOwner {
    minBackers = _min;
}

// Authorized contracts only
function slash(address user) external onlyAuthorizedSlasher {
    // Only LoanVoting can call this
}

// Members only
function backLoan(uint256 id) external onlyActiveMember {
    // Only DAO members can back loans
}
```

**5. Soul-Bound NFTs**

```solidity
function _update(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth)
    internal override returns (address)
{
    address from = _ownerOf(tokenId);

    // Allow minting (from == 0)
    // Prevent transfers (from != 0)
    require(from == address(0), "Soul-bound: cannot transfer");

    return super._update(to, tokenId, auth);
}
```

This prevents:
- Selling your reputation
- Reputation marketplaces
- Gaming the system

### Economic Security

**1. Slashing Prevents Bad Actors**

```
Cost of attack:
- Stake 500 tokens ($5,000 value)
- Back bad loans intentionally
- Get slashed 10% = lose $500
- Get kicked out of DAO

Benefit of attack:
- ??? (hard to see benefit)
- Maybe collude with borrower?
- But you lose money too

Net: Attack is not profitable
```

**2. 2/3 Majority Prevents Sybil**

To admit a fake/sybil account:
```
Attacker needs:
- 66.67% of voting power
- If total staked = 100,000 tokens
- Attacker needs 66,667 tokens
- At $10/token = $666,670

Cost to acquire voting power: $666,670
Benefit: Can admit 1 fake member
Net: Extremely expensive for little benefit
```

**3. Insurance Pool Sizing**

```
Target insurance ratio:
- Insurance pool / Total active loans = 10-15%

Example:
- Active loans: $1,000,000
- Target insurance: $100,000-$150,000

If default rate is 5%:
- Defaults: $50,000
- Insurance covers 30%: $15,000
- Well within pool capacity ✅

If default rate spikes to 20%:
- Defaults: $200,000
- Insurance covers 30%: $60,000
- Still within pool capacity ✅

If default rate hits 50% (crisis):
- Defaults: $500,000
- Insurance needed: $150,000
- Pool might be depleted ⚠️
- Coverage suspended until replenishment
```

**4. Collateral Floors**

```
Minimum 20% collateral means:
- Even with infinite backers, some skin in game
- Borrower always loses something on default
- Prevents pure "social engineering" attacks
- Protects protocol from total loss
```

### Operational Risks

**1. Oracle Risk (Credit Scores)**

Current: CreditScore contract uses oracle role
```
Risk: Oracle compromised → fake scores
Mitigation:
- Multiple oracles (decentralized)
- Score caching/delays
- Reputation cross-checks
- Community oversight
```

**2. DeFi Integration Risk (YieldingPool)**

Risk: Aave/Compound gets hacked
```
Mitigation:
- Diversify across multiple protocols
- Emergency withdrawal function
- Insurance coverage
- Regular audits of integrated protocols
```

**3. Governance Attacks**

**Flash Loan Attack:**
```
Scenario:
1. Attacker flash-loans 1M tokens
2. Stakes them all
3. Votes on proposal
4. Unstakes and returns loan

Prevention:
- Unstaking cooldown (7 days)
- Voting weight snapshots
- Minimum staking period before voting
```

**Whale Dominance:**
```
Scenario:
- One person has 51% of tokens
- Controls all votes

Mitigation:
- Quadratic voting (future)
- Delegation system
- Tiered voting (reputation-weighted)
- Community veto rights
```

---

## Deployment & Setup

### Prerequisites

**1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Node.js and npm
node --version  # v18+ required
npm --version

# Hardhat
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# OpenZeppelin contracts
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

**2. Existing Contracts**

You need these deployed first:
- MockUSDT (or real stablecoin)
- LendingPool
- LoanManager
- CreditScore

Save their addresses.

### Deployment Steps

**Step 1: Set Environment Variables**

```bash
# In .env file
STABLECOIN_ADDRESS=0x1234...  # Your MockUSDT
LOAN_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x5678... # Your LoanManager
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabcd...         # Deployer private key
NETWORK=sepolia               # or mainnet
```

**Step 2: Run Deployment Script**

```bash
cd packages/contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_dao.js --network sepolia
```

**What happens:**
```
1. Deploys GovernanceToken
   ├─ Name: "SME DAO Token"
   ├─ Symbol: "SMEDAO"
   └─ Initial supply: 1,000,000 tokens

2. Deploys ReputationNFT
   └─ Name: "DAO Reputation"

3. Deploys DAOMembership
   ├─ Links to GovernanceToken
   └─ Links to ReputationNFT

4. Deploys YieldingPool
   ├─ Links to stablecoin
   └─ Links to DAOMembership

5. Deploys InsurancePool
   └─ Links to stablecoin

6. Deploys LoanVoting
   ├─ Links to GovernanceToken
   ├─ Links to ReputationNFT
   ├─ Links to DAOMembership
   └─ Links to LoanManager

7. Configures authorizations
   ├─ DAOMembership → can update reputations
   ├─ LoanVoting → can update reputations
   ├─ LoanVoting → can slash stakes
   └─ LoanVoting → can use insurance pool

8. Mints initial reputation NFT for deployer

9. Saves addresses to JSON file
```

**Step 3: Verify Contracts (Optional but Recommended)**

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia \
  GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_ADDRESS \
  "SME DAO Token" \
  "SMEDAO" \
  "1000000000000000000000000"

# Repeat for each contract
```

**Step 4: Initial Configuration**

```javascript
// Set yield strategy for YieldingPool
await yieldingPool.setYieldStrategy(AAVE_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS)

// Fund insurance pool with initial capital
await stablecoin.transfer(insurancePool.address, 10000 * 10**6)

// Adjust parameters if needed
await loanVoting.setMinBackers(3)
await loanVoting.setMinStakeToBack(500 * 10**18)
```

### Post-Deployment Checklist

## Testing Guide

### Unit Tests

Test each contract independently:

**GovernanceToken Tests:**
```javascript
describe("GovernanceToken", function() {
    it("Should allow staking", async function() {
        await token.stake(parseEther("100"))
        expect(await token.stakes(user.address)).to.equal(parseEther("100"))
    })

    it("Should enforce cooldown period", async function() {
        await token.requestUnstake(parseEther("100"))
        await expect(token.unstake()).to.be.revertedWith("Cooldown not finished")
    })

    it("Should slash bad actors", async function() {
        await token.stake(parseEther("1000"))
        await token.authorizeSlasher(slasher.address)
        await token.connect(slasher).slash(user.address, "Bad backing")

        // Should have lost 10%
        expect(await token.stakes(user.address)).to.equal(parseEther("900"))
    })
})
```

**ReputationNFT Tests:**
```javascript
describe("ReputationNFT", function() {
    it("Should start with neutral score", async function() {
        await nft.mintReputation(user.address)
        const rep = await nft.getReputation(user.address)
        expect(rep.reputationScore).to.equal(500)
    })

    it("Should prevent transfers", async function() {
        await nft.mintReputation(user.address)
        await expect(
            nft.transferFrom(user.address, other.address, 1)
        ).to.be.revertedWith("Soul-bound")
    })

    it("Should update score on backing", async function() {
        await nft.mintReputation(user.address)
        await nft.recordBacking(user.address, true) // Success

        const rep = await nft.getReputation(user.address)
        expect(rep.reputationScore).to.be.gt(500)
    })
})
```

### Integration Tests

Test contracts working together:

```javascript
describe("Complete Loan Flow", function() {
    it("Should process successful loan", async function() {
        // 1. New member admitted
        await membership.proposeMembership(borrower, "Good person")
        // ... voting ...
        await membership.executeProposal(0)

        // 2. Member requests loan
        await loanVoting.connect(borrower).requestLoan(
            parseEther("1000"),
            40 // 40% collateral
        )

        // 3. Other members back it
        for (let backer of backers) {
            await token.connect(backer).stake(parseEther("500"))
            await loanVoting.connect(backer).backLoan(0)
        }

        // 4. Execute loan
        await time.increase(3 * 24 * 60 * 60) // 3 days
        await loanVoting.executeRequest(0)

        // 5. Verify loan approved
        const request = await loanVoting.getRequest(0)
        expect(request.approved).to.be.true

        // 6. Borrower repays
        await loanManager.connect(borrower).repayLoan(parseEther("1200"))
        await loanVoting.handleRepayment(0)

        // 7. Verify reputations increased
        for (let backer of backers) {
            const rep = await nft.getReputation(backer.address)
            expect(rep.successfulBacked).to.equal(1)
        }
    })
})
```

### Scenario Tests

Test edge cases and attacks:

```javascript
describe("Attack Scenarios", function() {
    it("Should prevent flash loan governance attack", async function() {
        // Stake tokens
        await token.stake(parseEther("10000"))

        // Try to vote and unstake immediately
        await membership.vote(0, true)
        await expect(
            token.unstake()
        ).to.be.revertedWith("No pending unstake")

        // Must request first
        await token.requestUnstake(parseEther("10000"))

        // Still can't unstake (7 day cooldown)
        await expect(
            token.unstake()
        ).to.be.revertedWith("Cooldown not finished")
    })

    it("Should handle insurance pool depletion", async function() {
        // Create many defaults that drain insurance
        // ...

        // When pool below minimum
        const coverage = await insurance.calculateCoverage(parseEther("1000"))
        expect(coverage).to.equal(0) // No coverage
    })
})
```
