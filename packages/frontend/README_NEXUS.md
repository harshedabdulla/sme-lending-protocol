# Prism Finance - Avail Nexus SDK Integration

This document outlines how Prism Finance integrates with Avail Nexus SDK to provide cross-chain lending and DeFi functionality.

## Overview

Prism Finance is a social collateral protocol that reduces loan collateral requirements through community backing. With Avail Nexus SDK integration, the protocol now supports:

- **Cross-chain loan issuance** across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum
- **Unified balance tracking** across multiple chains
- **Cross-chain yield farming** with optimal liquidity allocation
- **DAO-based governance** with multi-chain voting
- **Gas management** and refueling across chains

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **NexusContext** - Manages Nexus SDK initialization and state
2. **Cross-chain Loan System** - Handles loan requests across chains
3. **Unified Balance Dashboard** - Shows balances across all supported chains
4. **DAO Governance** - Multi-chain proposal creation and voting
5. **Gas Manager** - Cross-chain gas optimization and refueling

### Supported Chains

- **Ethereum** - Main governance and lending chain
- **Polygon** - Low-cost transactions and yield farming
- **Arbitrum** - High-performance lending operations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Nexus SDK Integration

```javascript
// Initialize Nexus SDK
const nexus = new Nexus({
  network: "testnet",
  wallet: walletProvider,
});

// Create cross-chain intents
const intent = await nexus.createIntent({
  type: 'loan_request',
  fromChain: 'ethereum',
  toChain: 'polygon',
  amount: parseUnits('10000', 6),
  borrower: address,
  token: 'USDT',
});
```

### 2. Cross-Chain Loan Issuance

The loan system supports cross-chain operations through Nexus SDK:

- **Bridge & Execute** - Loans are disbursed across optimal chains
- **Unified Reputation** - Credit scores are maintained across chains
- **Cross-chain Collateral** - Collateral can be provided on different chains

```javascript
// Cross-chain loan request
const loanIntent = await createCrossChainIntent({
  type: 'loan_request',
  fromChain: 'ethereum',
  toChain: selectedChain,
  amount: parseUnits(amount, 6),
  borrower: address,
  collateral: BigInt(collateral),
  token: 'USDT',
});
```

### 3. Unified Balance Dashboard

Users can view their balances across all supported chains:

```javascript
// Get unified balances
const balances = await getUnifiedBalances();
// Returns: { ethereum: { USDT: 1000 }, polygon: { USDT: 500 }, ... }
```

### 4. Cross-Chain Yield Farming

The yield pool supports multi-chain strategies:

- **Automatic Chain Selection** - Optimal yield across chains
- **Cross-chain Deposits** - Deposit on one chain, farm on another
- **Unified Yield Tracking** - Combined yield from all chains

```javascript
// Cross-chain yield deposit
const yieldIntent = await createCrossChainIntent({
  type: 'cross_chain_yield_deposit',
  fromChain: 'ethereum',
  toChain: selectedChain,
  amount: parseUnits(depositAmount, 6),
  strategy: 'multi_chain_yield',
});
```

### 5. DAO Governance

Multi-chain governance with unified voting:

- **Cross-chain Proposals** - Create proposals that affect multiple chains
- **Unified Voting** - Vote on proposals regardless of chain
- **Reputation Tracking** - Governance power maintained across chains

```javascript
// Cross-chain DAO proposal
const proposalIntent = await createCrossChainIntent({
  type: 'dao_proposal',
  fromChain: 'ethereum',
  toChain: 'ethereum',
  candidate: candidateAddress,
  proposer: address,
  reason: reason,
  proposalType: 'membership',
});
```

### 6. Gas Management

Cross-chain gas optimization:

- **Gas Refueling** - Refuel gas on different chains
- **Gas Price Optimization** - Choose optimal chains for transactions
- **Transaction Batching** - Reduce gas costs through batching

```javascript
// Gas refuel intent
const refuelIntent = await createCrossChainIntent({
  type: 'gas_refuel',
  fromChain: 'ethereum',
  toChain: selectedChain,
  amount: parseFloat(refuelAmount),
  user: address,
  token: selectedChain === 'polygon' ? 'MATIC' : 'ETH',
});
```

## Key Features

### Track 1: Unchained Apps
